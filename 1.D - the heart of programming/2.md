# What I wish I'd been taught

- Programming isn't about languages
- The language ultimately doesn't matter much*
- There's not a lot of memorizing --> DONT MEMORIZE SYNTAX, GOOGLE EXIST
- Most programming isn't about math*
- Programming languages are simpler than human ones
- Programming is really about solving problems algorithmically
- It's about explaining things to the idiot computer

*Well, if anything, maybe about discrete math.
