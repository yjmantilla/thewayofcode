# The main principles of programming

Programming is about solving problems algorithmically with the following concepts:

1. memory and variables
1. data types and structures
    <!-- types:
        numeric
        text
        boolean
    structures:
        collections (arrays,lists,sets)
        dictionaries (forms) -->
1. interacting and changing data: operators
1. sequence logic & the mind of the machine
    <!-- memory (what the past left me)
    state (my present)
    the next step (my future) -->
1. user interaction
1. legibility
    <!-- commenting
    identation
    expresiviness (good naming ie) -->
1. branching
1. iteration
1. modularity
    <!-- functions
    procedures
    libraries -->
1. failing with style
    <!-- - no worries, dont fear failure
    - searching for help
    - debugging -->

## honorable mentions

- scope
- referencing
- mutability
- modularity through classes
- other data structures
- and many more....
